# Os_Assignment

1. Considering the arrival time and burst time requirement of the process the scheduler schedules the processes by interrupting the processor after every 6 units of time and does consider the completion of the process in this iteration. The scheduler than checks for the number of process waiting for the processor and allots the processor to the process but interrupting the processor every 10 unit of time and considers the completion of the processes in this iteration. The scheduler checks the number of processes waiting in the queue for the processor after the second iteration and gives the processor to the process which needs more time to complete than the other processes to go in the terminated state.


2. There are 3 student processes and 1 teacher process. Students are supposed to do their assignments and they need 3 things for that pen, paper and question paper. The teacher has an infinite supply of all the three things. One students has pen,an other has paper and
another has question paper. The teacher places two things on a shared table and the student having the third complementary thing makes the assignment and tells the teacher on completion. The teacher then places another two things out of the three and again the student having the third thing makes the assignment and tells the teacher on completion. This cycle continues. Write a programme to synchronize the teacher and the students.
